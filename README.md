# Course Manager App (Full Stack React, Node.js, Express and Sequelize with REST API)

Purpose  - The purpose of this application is to allow users to manage course information. The full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In this project:
* Set up REST API with `Node,js`, `Express` and `Sequelize ORM`
* Using the `Create React App` tool to set up project on client side
* Use `JavaScript` and `JSX` to build out the components for your application in a modular fashion.
* Use `React Router` to set up your routes.
* Use `React Context API` to pass data to components without having to pass props manually at every single level.
* Use the `Fetch API` to fetch data from your REST API.
* Allow users to `sign up` and use `basic authentication` to support users signing in.
* Add to the supplied `CSS` to personalize the project.
